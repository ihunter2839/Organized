# Requesting Records

Collecting public records relating to police behavior directly from police departments is at the core of this project. Although the records we hope to gather
are, for the most part, already considered public information, they still need to be specifically requested from police departments such that they can be viewed
and made consistently available for all.

## General Information on Requesting Records

When we talk about requesting information from the Government, many folks will no doubt think of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), which requires
full or partial disclosure of information and documents held by the United States government. Although it may at first glance seem that this act would give citizens
the right to request documents from law enforcement, it is important to note that the FOIA only pertains to the **executive branch** of the federal governemt, 
making it an invalid basis for requesting records from your local, state managed department.  

Instead, most states have enacted their own Freedom of Information laws which determine what sorts of information are available for full or partial disclosure at the
public's request. This means that the information that is available in one state may *not be* available in another, and the process used to obtain records can vary 
significantly between states. Our goal is to summarize the crucial laws and regulations for all states within this project to make it simple for citizens to understand
the status of Freedom of Information laws in their state. Additionaly, we aim to provide request templates for each state that are preformatted with relevant legal
information such that citizens can send requests without having to write anything more than their name and return email. 


## How to Request Records

If you are interested in requesting records from police departments, you can get started immediately using our request templates for your state. Enter the necessary 
personal information into the template, like your name and email address, and send the request to the department's Chief of Records or general email address. If you
would like your request to be added to the department's public request log, please either cc <info@organizeapp.org> to your request email. Alternatively, you can add
the request information diretly to the relevant department's `requests.md` file and submit the changes in a new pull request. 

## Other Ways to Contribute

There are additional ways in which you can contribute to the Organized community and make requesting records easier for everyone. 

### Drafting Request Templates

New request templates which can be used to request records for a particular department or state are welcomed. Our current templates are generally based off existing
public resources that have been drafted by legal professionals. All templates should reference any sources that are copied or paraphrased for the creation of the 
template. You can email your template to <info@organizeapp.org> or submit a new pull request with the template as a new file under the associated department's 
directory.

### State and Department Information READMEs

Unfortunately, requesting police records is far from a streamlined, consistent process, and there are significant differences between the laws and regulations that
exist between states and even between inter-state departments. These differences make it crucial for a project like this to accurately document the relevant laws,
regulations, and request processes on a state and department level. We aim to provide this important information in a simple summary that is front and center when
viewing a state or departments' directory. To accomplish this, we are making use of Github's README feature as well as simple Markdown formatting. If you are
unfamiliar with Markdown, it is simple to get started! Check out this link on the [basics of markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax) and this link 
on [using README files](https://guides.github.com/features/wikis/#creating-a-readme). To add an information page, create a new pull request with a file name 
`README.md` under the associated state or department directory. If you have questions about this process, feel free to email <info@organizeapp.org> and we can 
assist you with the process of getting your information page into the repository.
