# Submitting Records to Organize

The goal of this project is to collect and house all public information relevant to police behavior within the United States. This is a pretty ambitious task,
and we will need the help of the community to get it done!

## What is a record?

We use the term "record" throughout this project - so what exactly is a record? Records can refer to a wide variety of documents, files, and text, such as:

+ Official forms, documents, and written information from police departments
+ Body camera footage or dash camera footage from an incident
+ Camera footage from a citizen's cellphone or other recording device
+ Text or written communication regarding information requests

This list is by no means comprehensive - if you believe you have some other piece of data you'd like to submit, please send it along and the community can
help decide if the information is relevant. 

## How Can I Submit Records?
If you already have records that you have previously requested from the police and received, you can submit them immediately to our project. 
If possible, please also include some additional details to help us categorize your records.

+ What was the intent when requesting these records? (Ex. lawsuit against department, research into department policy)
+ Did you receive all of the information that you requested? (Or, were some files / information explicitly denied?)
+ Your contact information

### Submit Records By Email
Send your documents, description, and any other information to our core team at <info@organizeapp.org>. @ihunter2839 and @anujk15 will manage these emails for 
the near future and integrate your files and information into this repository. Your records will be housed in a unique directory associated with the department 
from which the information was requested.

### Submit Records By Pull Request
Create a new PR to this repository with your documents, text, and any other information you'd like to submit in a new directory within the associated department's
directory as its parent. @ihunter2839 and @anujk15 will accept the pull request so that the community can access the information immediately!
