## Relevant Laws and Regulations

### Public Records Law
> In 2017, the Oregon legislature passed significant improvements to public records laws and created the Oregon Sunshine Committee to help make sure the laws are working. Its work includes reviewing the hundreds of exemptions that can keep government information out of public hands, with the goal of creating a more transparent government...

>Unfortunately, Oregon’s public records law is deliberately set up to make it difficult for the public to learn about a police officer’s disciplinary record. If an ordinary government employee is found guilty of wrongdoing during a disciplinary proceeding, the documents related to that proceeding are exempt from public records requests. Police officers are afforded an even greater level of secrecy; personnel disciplinary actions for police officers are typically withheld whether the officer is found guilty of wrongdoing or not. This shrouds both the questionable actions of police and the efficacy of the disciplinary system in secrecy.

### House Bill 4207
> In the aftermath of the death of George Floyd in police custody, Oregon has released the names of over 1,700 officers whose transgressions over the past 50 years were so serious that they were banned from working in law enforcement in the state.  
The online posting last week came after the state Legislature created a law requiring the Department of Public Safety Standards and Training to establish a statewide public database of officers whose certification has been revoked or suspended.
