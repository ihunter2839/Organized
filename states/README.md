# State Directories

Each state has a unique directory in our project, and our goal is to create subdirectories for every department in the nation. To find your department, click on the
directory associated with your state. States and departments are organized in alphabetical order.

## State Specific Information 

Within each states' directory you will find a summary of the relevant laws, regulations, and information related to obtaining police records in that particular state.
These pages are the ideal place to add state specific Freedom of Information laws, as well as any notable caveats or exemptions. 

## Request Templates

Each state directory also contains a `request_templates.md` file, which is where request templates for community use are stored. The community may find that having
multiple templates for different types or scopes of requests may be useful - for the time being, these can all reside in a single `request_templates.md` file.
