RE: Request for Public Records Available Under SB1421

To Whom It May Concern:

I request the release of records from the past calendar year under the California Public Records Act, Gov’t Code §§ 6250 et seq., California Penal Code §§832.7-832.8, and Art. I, § 3(b) of the California Constitution. I seek copies of all records in your office’s possession, regardless of who created them. Records include all investigative reports; photographic, audio, and video evidence; transcripts or recordings of interviews; autopsy reports; all materials compiled and presented for review to the district attorney or to any person or body charged with determining whether to file criminal charges against an officer in connection with an incident, or whether the officer’s action was consistent with law and agency policy for purposes of discipline or administrative action, or what discipline to impose or corrective action to take; documents setting forth findings or recommended findings; and copies of disciplinary records relating to the incident, including any letters of intent to impose discipline, any documents reflecting modifications of discipline due to the Skelly or grievance process, and letters indicating final imposition of discipline or other documentation reflecting implementation of corrective action.

See Cal. Gov’t Code §6255.
