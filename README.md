# Organize
A single, comprehensive, and public database of police misconduct information. :policewoman: :us: :partying_face:

## What is this project?
Our goal is to make it simple for individuals to participate in collecting and publishing available information on police misconduct. We provide free and consistent access to the data so everyone can be an informed part of their communities' discussions on police behavior and reform. :statue_of_liberty:

### Request Reports from your Local Department
The first step is to request all police misconduct reports that are publicly available from your local department. Depending on the state you live in, the scope of these records will vary. Once this is completed, an entry will get added to the public log for the department that can help the community track the progress of receiving the records. :detective:

### Upload the Records to Organize
Once the records have been received from your local department, you can upload the files directly to Organize repository so that everyone in the community can have access to the raw information. The Organize community will also take the files and integrate the information into our national database of police misconduct information, making it possible for individuals and organizations to easily and consistenly analyze the data from communities around the nation. :technologist:
