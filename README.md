# Organize
A single, comprehensive, and public database of police misconduct information. 

## What is this project?
Our goal is to make it simple for individuals to participate in collecting and publishing
available information on police misconduct. We provide free and consistent access to the 
data so everyone can be an informed part of their communities' discussions on police behavior
and reform.
